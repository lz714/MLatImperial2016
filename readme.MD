### Initial preparations (getting access to cloud)

1. register at [github](https://github.com/)
2. register at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
3. login to [everware](https://everware.rep.school.yandex.net/) with your github account. 
   Put `docker:arogozhnikov/mlatimperial2016` in the field for url.
   Everware will start a personal container (with copy of this repository)
4. (at everware) in the folder `MLatImperial2016` click on notebook `0 - Initial notebook`. 
   Run it (`Cell > Run All`) from the beginning up to the end. 
   It should generate a basic submission and provide a link to download it.
6. download a submission and upload it to [kaggle challenge](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/sms-spam-classification).

To get an access to the cloud **again**, just go to [everware](https://everware.rep.school.yandex.net/) - it will keep all results of your work. Please *don't logout* from everware - this will destroy container with all your results.


To dive faster into data analysis it is suggested to study the essentials of python and its scientific libraries using  [recommended tutorials](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/MLatImperial2016/wiki#tutorials). On the first seminar we will introduce them to you but to complete the excercises you will need to study most of them yourself. You can practice your skills by creating test ipython notebook on [everware](https://everware.rep.school.yandex.net/) or [install python on your computer](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/MLatImperial2016/wiki#install-python-on-your-computer).
